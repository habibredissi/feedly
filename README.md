# Feedly Frontend Challenge

The purpose of this exercise is to help you showcase your knowledge of Javascript, React, CSS, and your attention to detail.

Our design team has specced out an auto-completion experience of a sample &quot;my favorite books&quot; app. You can see the spec in this PDF: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9DWS9i5dsHY7T2zjAbz2wG2LO1oEBC7/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9DWS9i5dsHY7T2zjAbz2wG2LO1oEBC7/view?usp=sharing)

Our dev team has created a JSON and a simple Javascript service that gives you asynchronous access to a list of books. You can download them here:

Your mission is to use this service to implement the auto-completion experience defined in the spec utilizing Webpack, Javascript, React, and SASS (BEM Style). Feel free to modify the service if you see room for improvement, as long as the mocked server delay remains in place.

We will be paying attention to:

- Your attention to detail (how close to the spec is the implementation)
- Your design patterns
- The quality of your JS and CSS code
- Your consideration of edge cases

Feel free to think about this as a collaborative process. The dev and design teams are available if you have any questions.

**Deliverables:**

A project we can unzip, build, and run.

A link to a private Github Repository where the team can review the code

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
